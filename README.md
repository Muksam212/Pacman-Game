# Pacman-Game


Introducing one of the exciting (Pacman) 2D-Game using PY-Game Module. I hope you will find enjoyfull. If you want to play this game simply clone with ssh key.

Pac-Man originally called Puck Man in Japan, is a 1980 maze action video game developed and released by Namco for arcades.
In North America, the game was released by Midway Manufacturing as part of its licensing agreement with Namco America. 
The player controls Pac-Man, who must eat all the dots inside an enclosed maze while avoiding four colored ghosts. 
Eating large flashing dots called "Power Pellets" causes the ghosts to temporarily turn blue, allowing Pac-Man to eat them for bonus points.

Thank You..!!
